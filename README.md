# 📊 E-Commerce Data Analysis

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab compatible).

## 🚀 Project Overview

The notebook includes the following:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, data types, and formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Top-selling products
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Customer segmentation
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
